Helloww!! Now that you checked my profile out , these rules apply for my ponytown!

1. Im aroace, i dont really like flirting/romantic interactions, you must ask if i allow you to do.
2. Please dont attach to me too badly, ive got much stuff going on irl, i might get uncomfortable.
3. If i death threat, turn rude, it definetly is a sign you are annoying me/making me uncomfortable.


Thanks for reading, have a nice day!

Sincerely, EffervescentLotus aka. Vivi ^^
